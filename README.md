# Class Roster Project

## Overview
This C++ project is a backend implementation for a class roster program. It allows users to manage a list of students and perform various operations such as adding, removing, and searching for records.

## Features

- Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations for students.
- Support for multiple student's characteristics.
- Search functionality for finding specific records by name, ID, or other criteria
- Data validation and error handling for invalid input

## Design

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles are used to encapsulate data and behavior into classes
- The program uses a text-based interface for user input and output [STDOUT]
- All data is stored in memory

## Files

- classroster.sln: the solution file for Visual Studio
- classroster.vcxproj: The main program file 
- degree.h: The header file for the DegreeProgram enum object.
- main.cpp: The main class of the Class Roster project that contains the implementation of the class roster logic
- roster.cpp: The implementation of the Roster class
- roster.h: The header file for the Class class
- student.cpp: The implementation of the Student class
- student.h: The header file for the Student class

## Future Development

- Implement data persistence using files or databases
- Add more features such as grading, attendance tracking, or course scheduling
- Implement a GUI for better experience.
